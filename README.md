ðŸŽ¯ Credit Card Fraud Detection 

This is a **Machine Learning project** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a classification model.  
The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

---

## Dataset

  - Highly imbalanced dataset:
  - Total transactions: 284,807
  - Fraudulent: 492 (0.17%)

---

##  Project Workflow

 **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values
- Feature scaling
- Address class imbalance (SMOTE)

 **Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Distribution of classes
- Correlation heatmap
- Amount vs. class

 **Step 3: Model Training**
- Algorithms used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  

 **Step 4: Model Evaluation**
- Metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall
  - F1-score
  - ROC-AUC

 **Step 5: Save Model**
- Trained model is saved as `.pkl` for deployment.

---
 using:
 
- Python 3
- Libraries:
  - Pandas, Numpy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)
